# ReadingClub

This is the code base of our Weekend Reading Club.

1. [cs224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)

this is a very new  and cool class, stanford had this class last year, but with updated slides and assignments this spring. the class provide the train/valid/test data, save your time to collect data, which is always key obstacle to block beginers. And also the class provide large part of the assignment code, only leave the most important part for you to complete. this is so wonderful, I did not see any other learning materials can compete with this. 

    1. assignment 1 
    
    basic but very important, which shows you how to leverage numpy to do linear algebra calcualtions. 
    the contents include:

        * softmax and sigmoid function
        * gradcheck
        * simple 3 layers neural network
        * SGD framework
        * word2vec
        * sentence sentiment classifer 

    2. assignment 2 

    tensorflow basic usage. (with tf API r1.5)

        * softmax
        * dependency parsing (To update)
        * RNN language model.
